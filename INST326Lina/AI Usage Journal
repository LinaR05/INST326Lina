Week 1
This week, I used AI to help me find affordable places to stay as I plan for future travels. It made comparing hotel and Airbnb prices much faster and even suggested some destinations I hadnâ€™t considered. I also used AI to brainstorm some ideas for personal projects and areas I can grow more on or focus some more time on more. I also used AI to find ways to improve in my current internship by asking for tips on productivity. This week using AI has helped me save time, generate new ideas, and look more into both my personal and professional goals. 

Week 2
This week, I used AI to help me find the "best" food recommendations in new jersey city. I also asked it what are unique places to visit in new jersey that I cannot find in the DMV. It gave me a list of places and explained why those places were special. I also asked AI to built be an itinerary for 2 days in New York. It gave me New Yorks most common and popular spots. I would say I used AI a good amount this week for building an itinerary or ideas on what to do in New Jersey and New York.  

Week 3 
This week, I used AI to generate ideas for activities to do with my sister. She is coming from out of the country, so I asked AI to provide me with things to do that are unique to the United States. I also asked for it to give me some recommendations for places to eat since my sister is pescatarian, but I am allergic to fish, so I need to find places that have fish and non-fish options. I also asked AI for nice places to go bike riding and hiking.
