Week 1
This week, I used AI to help me find affordable places to stay as I plan for future travels. It made comparing hotel and Airbnb prices much faster and even suggested some destinations I hadnâ€™t considered. I also used AI to brainstorm some ideas for personal projects and areas I can grow more on or focus some more time on more. I also used AI to find ways to improve in my current internship by asking for tips on productivity. This week using AI has helped me save time, generate new ideas, and look more into both my personal and professional goals.
